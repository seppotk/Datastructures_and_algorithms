## Task 2

There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. There is a simple implementations in `./src/` folder. Discuss how the code works.

## Task 3

- There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs or **3 stairs** at a time. Write a program that counts the number of ways, the person can reach the top. You can use the following program as a starter `./src/staircase1.cpp`. Also the link below might useful:
