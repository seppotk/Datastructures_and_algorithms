# Extra: Pair programming 3

> Please locate your breakout-room in the Excel sheet: `1-pair-programming.xls`

1. Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 50.
- Numbers under 10 should be displayed with leading 0 e.g. 01, 02 etc.
- Every line contains only 10 numbers
- The output should be as in the `screenshot.png`file

2. Whatâ€™s wrong with the following for loop?

```cpp
for (unsigned int count{ 9 }; count >= 0; --count)
    std::cout << count << ' ';
```

3. Write a for loop that prints every even number from 0 to 20.
