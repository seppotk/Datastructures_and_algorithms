# Homework

Estimated workload is  about 2hours 20min: 

- Videos: 1hour 40min 
- Knowledge check: 40 min

THE KNOWLEDGE CHECK QUESTIONS ARE IN THE ATTACHED FILE (Readme.md). You can also find them in Moodle.

## Part A: Video recording
> Please choose one option from the followings:

- The first option is beginner friendly. We continue where we left off last week: From min 1:35 till 3:13 (About 1hour 40min)

- The second  option is also beginner friendly, but digs deeper. We continue where we left off last week: (From min 3:17 till 4:45) && (From min 7:04 till 7:14 (About 1hour 40min)

- The last option is 30 hour long, from Beginner to Advanced. 
We will cover bits and pieces from Chapter 5,6,8 and 9:
- Chapter 5: Flow Control @(7:01:58)
- Chapter 6: Loops @(7:53:49)

## Part B: Reflection & Knowledge check

1. Write a for loop that prints every even number from 0 to 20.

2. Write a function named sumTo() that takes an integer parameter named value, and returns the sum of all the numbers from 1 to value.

For example, sumTo(5) should return 15, which is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5`.

> Hint: Use a non-loop variable to accumulate the sum as you iterate from 1 to the input value, much like the pow() example above uses the total variable to accumulate the return value each iteration.

3. Name two reasons why we prefer to pass arguments by const reference instead of by non-const reference whenever possible.

4. What is the difference between a const pointer and a pointer-to-const?
