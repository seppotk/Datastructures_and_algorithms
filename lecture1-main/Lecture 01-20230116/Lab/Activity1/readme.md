# Activity 1

Your college is hosting a chess tournament, and they want to record the final positions of the pieces in each game on a sheet of paper with a chessboard printed on it. Your job is to write a program to print these pieces of paper. 

- The chessboard is an eight-by-eight pattern of squares that alternate between black and white, with the upper-left square being white. 
- To form the chessboard, you need to print out squares of light characters (spaces) and dark characters (such as *) as shown in the picture chess.png 

## Part A

- Discuss within the group how you approach this task from high level.
- Write a proof of concept as shown in the picture poc.png

Please use the online compiler at:

## Part B

In general clients are not 100% sure of want they want. How easily can you modify your code if your college  decides to modify the layout of the squares e.g every square will be represented by 7x7 characters instead of 3*5?
