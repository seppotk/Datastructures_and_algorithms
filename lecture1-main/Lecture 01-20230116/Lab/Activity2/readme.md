# Activity 2

The [following link](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/developing-your-first-program/), discusses how to write a program that 
- asks the user to enter an integer, 
- waits for them to input an integer, 
- then tells them what 2 times that number is. 

Here's a demo how the program works:

```bash
Enter an integer: 4
Double that number is: 8
```

## Part A

Within the group discuss and reflect on the different solutions:
- The not-good solution
- The mostly-good solution
- The preferred solution

## Part B

If **you have time**, discuss how you would modify the program to behave as follows:

```bash
Enter an integer: 5
Triple 4 is: 15
Double 4 is: 10
```
