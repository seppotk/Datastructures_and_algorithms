Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. 
- Your calculator should be able to handle the five basic math operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide on two input values. 
- Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: two integers values and a character to represent an operation. 
  - If the entry arguments are 35, 24, and +; the program output should be "The sum of 35 and 24 is 59"
