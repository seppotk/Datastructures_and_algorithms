In today's digital age, the field of computer science has become increasingly important in a wide range of industries. As such, it is becoming more and more essential for students from diverse fields to have a basic understanding of algorithms and data structures, even if they are not majoring in computer science.

This course is designed to introduce major/non-major students to the fundamental concepts of algorithms and data structures. Students will learn how to analyze problems and design algorithms. They will also learn about basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as more advanced topics such as graph algorithms, sorting, and searching.

Throughout the course, students will be encouraged to think critically and apply their knowledge to real-world problems. They will also have hands-on experience on how algorithms and data structures concepts are implemented in the C++ programming language.

<!--
By the end of the course, students shall have a solid understanding of the key concepts in algorithms and data structures, and will be able to use this knowledge to tackle complex problems in a variety of fields.
